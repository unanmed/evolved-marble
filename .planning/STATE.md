# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-15)

**Core value:** 战斗必须激烈好看 (battles must be intense and visually appealing)
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation & Deterministic Sim Core

## Current Position

Phase: 1 (Foundation & Deterministic Sim Core) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 4
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Milestone 1: Scope is the tactical combat layer only; kingdom/economy, LLM commander/director, and RL control are out of scope (interfaces reserved).
- Roadmap structure: determinism (Phases 1–2) is proven before any I/O or rendering attaches.
- Phase 2: pin the Rapier2D **deterministic** build (resolve `-deterministic` vs `-compat` + `enhanced-determinism` via a cross-machine golden-hash spike; settle pixel↔meter scale).
- [Phase 1]: TS7 removed baseUrl: the @/* -> src/* alias is expressed as a relative paths entry (./src/*); baseUrl dropped.
- [Phase 1]: Phase 1 removed only the TS predecessor tree (src/** + index.html); model/ + requirements.txt deferred to the Python-rebuild phase (tsc never checks them).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Determinism must be verified, not assumed** — Rapier guarantees determinism only of what is fed to it. Golden-hash gate must run in CI and across machines from Phase 1–2.
- **Watchability is a Core Value risk** — behavior-tree AI can produce degenerate/stalemate battles (0 damage); anti-stall invariants + automated watchability audit are gating criteria in Phase 4.
- **Spec numbers are reference-only** — damage/XP/stat values need empirical calibration (velocity threshold so `√Δv − 1 > 0` at typical closing speeds).
